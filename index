          <p class="answer" data-hint-image="submission-photos/IMG_2845 - annie hong.jpeg" data-next-section="#section2">
            No, they might take their vision for granted. Then again, everyone takes vision for granted and misses out on the little things.

          <p class="question">How do you feel in spaces where you can’t see far ahead?</p>
          <p class="answer" data-hint-image="submission-photos/IMG_2845 - annie hong.jpeg" data-next-section="#section2">
            I try to stay to myself when I can't see. However, it's almost comforting not being able to see everything or anyone as I tend to overthink. It's almost like I feel shrunken in those spaces.

          <p class="answer" data-hint-image="submission-photos/IMG_2845 - annie hong.jpeg" data-next-section="#section2">
           I think depending on how vivid the memory is, is how clear the memory is. Most memories are blurrier than how I saw them.

            I think it affects the way we perceive situations, which as a result impacts how we remember significant moments.

            Yes, I think it is natural for our brains to want to fill in the gaps that we aren't able to visually make out.

            I started wearing glasses in the 3rd grade; I remember the board started getting blurrier and blurrier. But before, I think everything was clear.
